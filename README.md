# Pure Simplicity TexturePack Introduction

If you are tired of various PVP TexturePacks, you may wish to try this simple and practical TexturePack, which is based on the Default 128x128 TexturePack.

The simple appearance reveals the exquisite interior, which is what I spent almost a year.

TexturePack was created for myself, and of course I am very happy to share with you, I hope you like it.

The minimum version of the TexturePack is 1.7.10. Although I know that version 1.7.10 is an older version and the current latest version is 1.13, this is just the beginning. And it will be gradually updated to a higher version. The future plan is to make it into 3d TexturePack

I will try my best to make this TexturePack, thank you for loving it!
